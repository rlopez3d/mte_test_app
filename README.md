# mte_test_app
Android application to test the Memory Tagging Extension, that implements most common memory bugs in Android code base.

This repository will initially contain only the apk of the MTE test application. It is associated with the a Learning Path "Memory Tagging Extension on Google Pixel 8". The Learning Path recommends downloading this application and install it on Google Pixel 8 phone to trigger a memory bug. If MTE is enabled on the device the application is guaranteed to break. The Learning Path shows how to capture a bug report. A bug report contains device logs, stack traces, and other diagnostic information to help users find and fix bugs in the application. If MTE is enabled on the device, the bug report will contain specific additional information about the memory bug. 

This repository will share later the source code of the application for a new Learning Path that will showcase how to debug applications in Android Studio with MTE enabled.
